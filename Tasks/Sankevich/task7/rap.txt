NAN MAN DA BU
NAN MAN DA BU

Om abogya beiroshanō
Makabodara mani handoma
Jinbara harabari tayaun
Naraku ni utau wa rokkonshōjō

If that's what you call karma, I must be a demon.
God knows.
God knows that no voice can be heard by the damned.

Gedō no kūsokuzeshiki sanzen no fujō
Ganpon no mumyō sanzen no shōjō
No forgiveness necessary.

In the light, that's my way.
Break off all vexations.
It's never over, yesterday.
I'm the time exile.

I am the Ghost of Vengeance.
(Calm Madness)
I'm the time exile.
(I'm the time exile)
Sever, tear, fear

Om abogya beiroshanō
Makabodara mani handoma
Jinbara harabari tayaun
Naraku ni utau wa rokkonshōjō

There is no salvation for the unforgiven.
God knows, there are those who will pay
the hand that is extended to them.

Gedō no kūsokuzeshiki sanzen no fujō
Ganpon no mumyō sanzen no shōjō
No forgiveness necessary

In the light, that's my way.
Break off all vexations.
Today, which will never begin.
I'm the time exile.

I am the Ghost of Vengeance.
(Calm Madness)
I don't need your sympathy.
Why won't anyone leave me alone?

If I had a comrade...
I wonder what I would tell them.
Yes, yes, I knew the answer.

In the light, that's not your way.
Break off all vexations.
Break off all vexations.
It's never over, yesterday.
No, don't stand still.

In the light
My vengeance will be sacrificed.
For the light
The pain kills the pain.
The hardest road lies ahead.
I will be a mirror of the world.

Om abogya beiroshanō
Makabodara mani handoma
Jinbara harabari tayaun
Naraku ni utau wa rokkonshōjō

I'm not the exile
Break off all vexations. (That's not your way)
You are not the exile

Om abogya beiroshanō
Makabodara mani handoma
Jinbara harabari tayaun
Naraku ni utau wa rokkonshōjō
